[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/etorreborre/eff-scalaz.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/etorreborre/eff-scalaz)

Extensible effects are an alternative to monad transformers for computing with effects in a functional way. 
This library is based on the "free-er" monad and an "open union" of effects described in 
Oleg Kiselyov in [Freer monads, more extensible effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).

You can learn more in the User Guide:

 - [included effects: `Reader`, `Writer`, `Eval`, `State`,...](http://etorreborre.github.io/eff-scalaz/org.specs2.site.OutOfTheBox.html)
 - [using an open or a closed union of effects](http://etorreborre.github.io/eff-scalaz/org.specs2.site.OpenClosed.html)
 - [create your own effects](http://etorreborre.github.io/eff-scalaz/org.specs2.site.CreateEffects.html)
 - [working with different effect stacks](http://etorreborre.github.io/eff-scalaz/org.specs2.site.TransformStack.html)
 
## Installation

You add `eff-scalaz` as an sbt dependency:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.specs2" %% "eff-scalaz" % "1.1"
```

or download it from [here](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/specs2/eff-scalaz_2.11/1.0/eff-scalaz_2.11-1.1.jar).
