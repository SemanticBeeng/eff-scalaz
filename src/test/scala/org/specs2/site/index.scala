Extensible effects are an alternative to monad transformers for computing with effects in a functional way.
This library is based on the "free-er" monad and an "open union" of effects described in
Oleg Kiselyov in [Freer monads, more extensible effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).

You can learn more in the following sections:

 - ${"your first effects" ~ Introduction}
 - ${"standard effects in eff-scalaz" ~ OutOfTheBox}: `Reader`, `Writer`, `Eval`, `State`,...
 - using an ${"open or a closed union of effects" ~ OpenClosed}
 - ${"create your own effects" ~/ CreateEffects}
 - ${"manipulate effect stacks" ~ TransformStack}
