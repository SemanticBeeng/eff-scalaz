/**
 * This is an example of a stack of effect with:
 *
 *  - 2 different writers: one for warnings, the other one for logging to the console
 *  - one "IO" effect
 *  - one Error effect
 *
 * The order of the effects in the stack definition is important.
 *
 * For example
 *
 *  Error |: Console |: Warnings |: Eval |: EffectsNil
 *
 *  will return warnings *and* failures: (String \/ A, Vector[String])
 *
 * Whereas
 *
 *  Console |: Warnings |: Error |: Eval |: EffectsNil
 *
 *  will return not warnings if there is a failure: String \/ (A, Vector[String])
 *
 * Also note that Eval is the last effect which means that nothing get evaluated until we run the last interpreter
